Before we explore the technical details, it's important to know the purpose of each component within our serverless email marketing application:


 • Amazon S3: Is a storage solution for our application that stores static assets such as HTML templates,
    pictures, and CSV files holding email lists or campaign data.

•	AWS SES: (Simple Email Service) allows us to send mass emails to our subscribers. SES offers a
    dependable and scalable email delivery platform with capabilities such as email validation,
    bounce handling, and reputation management.

•	AWS Lambda: Provides serverless compute capacity to run our application's backend logic.
    We'll utilize Lambda functions to handle incoming requests, business logic, and communication
    with other AWS services.  

 •	Amazon EventBridge: Enables us to manage and automate workflows by responding to events from
    various AWS services or custom sources. We'll utilize EventBridge to activate Lambda functions
    in response to certain events, such as new email subscriptions or campaign scheduling.
